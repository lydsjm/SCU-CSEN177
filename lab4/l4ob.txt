Step 1:
- No, I don't get the same result since i is a shared-state and is repeated.
- Running other demanding processes could effect the scheduling of the threads.
  It might delay the execution.
- The variables are shared state are stored in the stack.
- The variable is shared state, and it is stored on the stack.

Step 2:
- The main thread might exit before all the other threads that are created exit.
  So we might not hear from all the threads.

Step 3:
- I created a program that uses threads to peform a parallel matrix multiply.
  From what I saw, it seems to run well and correctly.
