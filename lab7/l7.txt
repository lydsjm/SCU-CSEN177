Title: Lab 7 - Steps
Description: write out the steps needed to setup/do this lab

Step 1
- launch VirtualBox and start the Minix3 machine

Step 2
- prepare to setup an FTP connection by using 'tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &'
- use 'ifconfig' in the virtual machine to find your ip address
- go into your file directory and click Others on the left side panel
- now, at the bottom add "ftp://ipaddress" and connect
- follow the prompt and login in as a registered user

Step 3
- to find a file that deals with "picking" a process, search through the files available after connecting
- go to the following folders: usr - src - kernels - proc.c
- open the file in VEdit, and edit the pick_proc function
- here is the added/changed code snippet
    for (q=0; q < NR_SCHED_QUEUES; q++) {	
        int random = rand() % 10;

        if (random <= 2 && q > 2)
            q = q % (NR_SCHED_QUEUES - 2) + 2;


        if(!(rp = rdy_head[q]))  { 
            TRACE(VF_PICKPROC, printf("queue %d empty\n", q););
            continue;
        }

Step 4
- now, run the following commands
    - cd /usr/src
    - make world
    - reboot
- and it should now take longer to reboot
