Description: write out the steps needed to setup/do this lab



Step 1
- if connecting remotely, install NoMachine and use the link 
    on SCU's website to help you download the necessary files
- then create a new virtual desktop and you should be able to open it
- if using the ECC, just log in and open Terminal

Step 2
- now to install and run Minix on the ECC, type virtualbox and it should open

Step 3
- select Expert Mode on the far right
- then click the three dots menu on Tools, select Networks, 
    go to Host-only Networks, and click Create to create a network called vboxnet0, 
    under the properties menu, select DHCP Server, Enable Server, and Apply
- now click on file on the top of the screen and create a new appliance
- when a screen pops us, type in /local/Vbox/minix3-1-7.ova, expand the
    Settings tab and set MAC Address Policy to Generate new MAC addresses 
    for all network adapters, then click Finish

Step 4
- start the VM
- to attach your keyboard to the VM, click the region where text appears
- to detach from the VM and get the cursor, press the ctrl button on the right of your keyboard

Step 5
- after it launches VM it will prompt you to input your username/password, instructions below
    - login: root
    - password: passwd (use this to set your password)
    - now it will prompt you to create your own password

Step 6
- to find a file to edit, it can be found in the /usr/src/ directory
- the file i used was main.c

Step 7
- to edit the file, i typed vi main.c
- this opened the main file
- to edit the file, i clicked i which allowed me to insert
- now i went to the line containing the printf statement and inserted my name
    - printf ("Lydia MINIX...)
- to exit and save changes, click esc, then type :wq

Step 8
- now that main.c is updated, type the following commands to see the changes
    - # cd /usr/src
    - # make world (this will take some time, once it is finished then move on)
    - # reboot
- you should now be able to see the changes that you made in the printf statement
