Step 1 - threadSync.c is different than threadHello.c program because all the threads return. Why?
- threadSync.c shows how thread synchronization works using semaphores while threadHello.c just shows how to create and join threads
- so the i variable that was creating issues in threadHello.c will not create the same issue here
Step 2-4
- these all ran well
