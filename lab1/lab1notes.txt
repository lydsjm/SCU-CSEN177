Lab 1 Notes
Step 1: I created the Shell file.
Step 2: I had the wrong username, so it gave me an error.
        But once I fixed it, the program ran well.
Step 3: I was able to successfully add in a way to compute the area of a circle.
        It took me some time to figure out the right formula/commands. Also, I had
        to create separate responses for rectangle and the circle because when I
        first tried it, it was in a loop. Once I fixed the issue, everything ran well.
