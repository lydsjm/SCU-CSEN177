Step 1-4
- I created the C program and compiled it.
- When I ran the program by just entering the Executable Name, 
  it said there was a segmentation fault.
- However, when setting the microseconds, then it ran well.
- Comparing delays of 500 and 5000, 500 was quicker than 5000.

Step 5
- I wrote my own program. I had some minor issues since I wasn't printing the PIDs
  correctly and individually. So, I edited my code then listed each process with its own pid 
  as well as with the corresponding pid of its parent/child to track the relationship.

Step 6
- I rewrote the program using threads instead of processes. Similar to Steps 1-4,
  I compiled the program.
- However, when compiling, I added -lpthread at the end of the command line.
- Then, I experimented with using 3000, 500, and 5000 as delay microseconds.
- As expected, 500 microseconds of delay returned the output the fastest.

Step 7
- I wrote a program where the parent process spawns a child that runs the ls command.
- My program ran well and I was able to see all the files that were in my folder.
